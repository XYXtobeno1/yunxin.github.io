Hello, I am Yunxin Xu, currently pursuing a degree in Digital Media Technology at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in Virtual Reality (VR) advised by [Prof. Hai-Ning Liang](https://cma.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-regular/hai-ning-liang/). In addition to my research achievements, this website serves as a platform where I share my course, project showcases, and involvement in extracurricular activities (in the future). It represents not only my personal space but also a reflection of my diverse interests and ongoing exploration in the field of technology. If you are interested in virtual reality and human-computer interaction, I welcome the opportunity for discussion and collaboration.    [CV](files/cv.pdf)

About My Major
------
My major is [Digital Media Technology](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/zh/study/undergraduate/digital-media-technology), which differs from traditional digital media studies by integrating multiple fields such as communication and information technology, computer science, and art design. This interdisciplinary background enables me to gain a comprehensive understanding of both computer software development and application, as well as a solid grasp of computer hardware. Through the study and practice across various disciplines, I am able to bridge the gap between technology development and creative design, equipping me with the ability to solve complex problems and adapt to the rapidly evolving technological landscape.
